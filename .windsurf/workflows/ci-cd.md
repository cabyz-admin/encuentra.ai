# CI/CD

## Principles
- **Fail fast, recover fast**: Catch problems early, deploy fixes quickly.
- **Everything as code**: Pipelines, infra, and secrets should all be versioned.

## Pipeline Design
- Use **parallel jobs** to speed up builds (e.g., lint, test, build in parallel).
- Use Turborepo’s **affected** commands to run only what changed for monorepo efficiency.
- Cache dependencies and build artifacts for faster runs.

## Security
- Store secrets in CI/CD provider’s secure vault, never in code or env files.
- Rotate secrets regularly and audit access.
- Run security scans (`bun audit`, SAST tools) as part of the pipeline.

## Deployment
- Automate deployments to staging and production.
- Use blue-green/canary strategies for zero-downtime.
- Require manual approval for production deploys if risk is high.

## Observability
- Publish build/test/deploy status to Slack or email.
- Store build logs and artifacts for traceability.
- Alert on failed builds, flaky tests, or slow deploys.

## Anti-patterns
- Avoid “works on my machine” by standardizing environment setup in CI.
- Don’t skip tests or lint for speed; optimize, but never at the cost of safety.
- Avoid manual steps—automation is the goal.

## Scaling & Future-proofing
- Modularize pipelines so adding new apps/packages is trivial.
- Periodically review and refactor pipeline steps for performance and clarity.
- Document pipeline structure and rationale for new contributors.

## Rationale
A robust CI/CD pipeline is the heartbeat of a modern engineering org. It enables safe, rapid iteration and builds trust in every deploy. Invest in observability, security, and speed from day one.

Example GitHub Actions workflow can be found in `.github/workflows/` if available.
