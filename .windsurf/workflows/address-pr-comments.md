# Addressing PR Comments

## Principles
- **Feedback is a gift**: Treat every comment as an opportunity to learn and improve the codebase.
- **Respond, don’t react**: Understand the context and reasoning behind feedback before acting.

## Workflow
1. **Acknowledge every comment**: Even if you disagree, respond with your reasoning.
2. **Apply changes iteratively**: Don’t batch all fixes at the end—address, push, and mark as resolved as you go.
3. **Ask clarifying questions**: If feedback is unclear, ask for specifics or examples.
4. **Document learnings**: If a comment reveals a gap in docs or standards, update them for the team.
5. **Automate where possible**: Use bots to enforce style, detect anti-patterns, or auto-assign reviewers.

## Anti-patterns
- Don’t ignore or dismiss comments—this erodes trust.
- Avoid endless back-and-forth; escalate to synchronous discussion if stuck.
- Don’t treat PR review as a gatekeeping ritual—make it collaborative.

## Scaling & Team Alignment
- Regularly review recurring feedback and turn it into lint rules or docs.
- Celebrate insightful comments and reviewers in retros.
- Use PR review analytics to spot bottlenecks or knowledge silos.

## Rationale
A healthy PR review culture compounds engineering effectiveness. It’s not just about merging code, but about building shared understanding and raising the bar for everyone.
