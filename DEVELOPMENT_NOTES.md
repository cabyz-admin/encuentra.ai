# Development Session Notes

## Session Date: 2025-05-27
## Features Built: Bolt.new Standalone Setup

### ✅ What Worked Well
- Successfully extracted standalone Next.js app from monorepo
- Copied real packages (@v1/supabase, @v1/ui, @v1/analytics) to maintain functionality
- Created working Bolt.new-compatible branch with all dependencies
- Established clear file structure mapping between standalone and monorepo

### 🚧 Challenges Encountered  
- Initial attempt created broken imports due to missing workspace dependencies
- Had to copy actual monorepo packages instead of creating simplified versions
- Import paths needed adjustment from @v1/* to @/lib/* and @/components/*
- Force push required due to git history conflicts

### 🔄 Improvements Made
- Real Supabase integration instead of mock implementation
- Actual UI components with proper TypeScript types
- Complete analytics and logging infrastructure
- Added all necessary dependencies to package.json

### 📝 Next Session Todos
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow in Bolt.new
- [ ] Verify all component imports work correctly
- [ ] Test database operations with real Supabase instance
- [ ] Create first feature using the 10x development rules

### 🎯 Patterns to Reuse
- Always copy real packages instead of creating simplified versions
- Use @/ prefix for all imports in standalone version
- Maintain same file structure patterns as monorepo for easier syncing
- Test both build and dev modes before committing

### ⚠️ Sync Warnings
- File: src/middleware.ts - Import path: @/lib/supabase/clients/middleware
- File: src/components/google-signin.tsx - Import path: @/components/ui/components/button  
- File: src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/page.tsx - Import path: @/lib/supabase/queries
- Remember to convert @/ back to @v1/* when syncing to monorepo

### 🔗 Important Links
- Bolt.new URL: https://github.com/cabyz-admin/encuentra.ai/tree/bolt-standalone
- Main Repo: https://github.com/cabyz-admin/encuentra.ai
- Staging Branch: (to be used for syncing changes back)

### 🎪 Next Development Focus
1. Build first feature in Bolt.new using established patterns
2. Test the complete sync process with a small change
3. Document any additional friction points
4. Optimize the development-to-production pipeline

**AI Assistant Note**: This session established the foundation for 10x faster development using Bolt.new as a rapid prototyping environment while maintaining production quality through the monorepo.
